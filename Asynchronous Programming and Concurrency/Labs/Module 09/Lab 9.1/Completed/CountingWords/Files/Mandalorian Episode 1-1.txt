[ The Mandalorian is seen walking toward a building, holding a beeping tracking fob. ]

[ Inside a cantina, two trawlers hold a Mythrol. ]

Alpha Trawler: (subtitle) Look at his glands! // (subtitle) I bet we could sell them at the port!

Mythrol: Please! Please! I have credits! Take them!

Alpha Trawler: (subtitle) He's young. The must will be sweet. // (subtitle) And now for the real prize...

[ The Mandalorian enters. ]

Alpha Trawler: (not subtitled) // (subtitle) You spilled my drink... // (subtitle) Hey, Mando! // (subtitle) I said, you spilled, my drink...

Bartender: He says you spilled his drink. // That's fine! It's on me.

Alpha Trawler: (subtitle) Is that real Beskar Steel?

Bartender: Here.

[ Fighting. ]

Mythrol: Thank you. Thank you very much. You got my heartfelt gratitude. // You know what... here, you take my credits. Buy yourself a drink.

[ The Mandalorian places a hologram puck on the table. ]

Mythrol: Uh... Is that a bounty puck? // Is that me? // Look... uh... there must be some mistake. I can get you more credits.

Din Djarin: I can bring you in warm... // or I can bring you in cold.

Title Screen

[ The Mandalorian and the handcuffed Mythrol are walking away from the cantina to a speeder stop. ]

Din Djarin: I need passage to the yards.

[ The ferryman calls a speeder which arrives with an R2 unit as pilot. ]

Din Djarin: No droids.

Ferryman: (subtitle) I assure you, this speeder is brand new. It's the latest model...

[ The Mandalorian tosses the ferryman a coin. ]

Ferryman: (subtitle) At your pleasure.

[ The ferryman calls another speeder, which arrives, in rough shape but with a human pilot. ]

Speeder Pilot: Where to?

[ The speeder flies across the icy plains. ]

Mythrol: You know what he's looking for... // You're looking for Ravinaks, right?

Speeder Pilot: It's clear right now. But be careful near the port. Everyone dumps their gray holds out. They think the whole entire planet is their own personal stink pit.

[ The speeder arrives at the Razor Crest. ]

Speeder Pilot: Here you are.

Mythrol: You're kidding me, right?

Din Djarin: Get out.

[ They get out of the speeder. ]

Mythrol: I'll hire us a Livery Cruiser. No big deal. It won't come out of your end. I'll pay for it. // I'm just trying to make it pleasant.

Speeder Pilot: Hey, it's time to go, so let's settle up.

[ The Mandalorian pays the pilot. ]

Speeder Pilot: I'd stay off the ice if I were you.

[ The speeder takes off. The Mandalorian and the Mythrol get ready to board the Razor Crest. ]

Mythrol: You think there's really something to worry about?

[ He watches the speeder – get eaten by a beast out on the ice. ]

Mythrol: Oh! Oh! Open the hatch! Open the hatch!

[ The Ravinak breaks through the ice toward the Razor Crest. The Mandalorian grabs the Mythrol and drags him into the ship. They get into the cockpit while the Ravinak grabs the Razor Crest's leg. ]

Mythrol: Dank farrik, that was close! Oh, my God. // Oh, my God. // "Stay off the ice." That's the understatement of the millennium.

[ They attempt to take off but the Ravinak holds on to the Razor Crest's leg. ]

Mythrol: It's taking us down. What're you doing? // It's got us! It's gonna take us under!

[ The Mandalorian leaves the cockpit. ]

Mythrol: Where you going? You gotta do something! We gotta get out of here!

[ The Mandalorian electrocutes the Ravinak and it lets go. ]

Mythrol: Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Yes. All right. Whew.

[ The Razor Crest takes off and leaves the planet. ]

[ Cut to the cockpit. ]

Mythrol: I like your ship. She's a classic. // Razor Crest, am I right? Pre-Empire? // I have a lot of credits, by the way. That's why I offered to hail a Cruiser.

[ No response. ]

Mythrol: How much are they paying you?

[ No response. ]

Mythrol: Is it true that you guys never take off your helmets?

[ No response. ]

Mythrol: Oh... Boy.

[ No response. ]

Mythrol: I think I have to use the vacc tube. // I mean I can do it here, but if you've never seen a Fledgling Mythrol evacuate their thorax, you're a lucky guy, trust me.

[ No response. The Mythrol gets up. ]

Mythrol: Clearly, there's nowhere for me to go. So, uh... I'm gonna look for that vacc tube if it's all the same to you?

[ No response. ]

Mythrol: Great.

[ The Mythrol leaves the cockpit and gets down into the belly of the ship. ]

Mythrol: Found it! Thanks. // It might take a while. I'm molting.

[ The Mythrol looks around, opens the weapons hold, and quickly closes it again. ]

Mythrol: Oh, this feels a lot better. // I haven't evacuated since the solstice. // Yeah. // I was hoping to be free for...uh... Life Day. // Maybe even, uh...

[ The Mythrol discovers the bounty hold with several carbon-frozen bounties. ]

Mythrol: Get home to the... family. // But I guess that's not gonna happen this year.

[ The Mandalorian suddenly appears behind the Mythrol. ]

Din Djarin: Probably not.

[ The Mandalorian grabs the Mythrol and shoves him in the on-board carbon-freezing chamber, then adds him to the line of carbon-frozen bounties. ]

[ Cut to the arrival on Nevarro. The Mandalorian walks into a cantina to meet Greef Karga of the Bounty Hunter Guild. ]

Greef Karga: Ah, that was fast. Did you catch them all?

[ The Mandalorian places the tracking fobs on the table. ]

Greef Karga: Good. I'll begin the off-load. // (not subtitled)

[ The Mandalorian sits. Greef Karga places credits on the table. ]

Din Djarin: These are Imperial Credits.

Greef Karga: They still spend.

Din Djarin: I don't know if you heard, but the Empire is gone.

Greef Karga: It's all I've got.

[ The Mandalorian grabs the tracking fobs back. Greef Karga stops him. ]

Greef Karga: Save the theatrics. Fine, I'll...

[ He places different credits on the table. ]

Greef Karga: I can do Calamari Flan But I can only pay half.

Din Djarin: Fine.

[ The Mandalorian places the tracker fobs back on the table and grabs the credits. ]

[ Cut to the crabon-frozen bounties being unloaded from the Razor Crest. ]

[ Cut back to the cantina. ]

Greef Karga: Hmm. I have a bail jumper, a bail jumper, another bail jumper, a wanted smuggler.

Din Djarin: I'll take them all.

Greef Karga: Nah, hold on. // There are other members of the Guild, and this is all I have.

Din Djarin: Why so slow?

Greef Karga: It's not slow at all. Actually, very busy. They just don't want to pay Guild rates. They don't mind if things get sloppy.

Din Djarin: What's your highest bounty?

Greef Karga: Not much. Five thousand.

Din Djarin: That won't even cover fuel these days.

Greef Karga: Hmm. // There is one job.

Din Djarin: Let's see the puck.

Greef Karga: No puck. Face to face. Direct commission. Deep pocket.

Din Djarin: Underworld?

Greef Karga: All I know is no chain code.

[ He pulls out a chit card. ]

Greef Karga: Do you want the chit or not?

[ The Mandalorian grabs the chit card and leaves. He walks through town to a building. He knocks. A sensor eye appears asking for identification in an un-subtitled foreign language. The Mandalorian shows the chit card which the sensor reads, saying something again in an un-subtitled foreign language. The door opens and the Mandalorian enters the building. ]

Client: Greef Karga said you were coming.

[ The Mandalorian walks into the room to stand before the client. ]

Din Djarin: What else did he say?

Client: He said you were the best in the parsec.

[ A door suddenly opens, and before the person even enters, the Mandalorian draws his weapons, as do the stormtroopers. ]

Stormtrooper: Freeze!

Dr. Pershing: No!

Stormtrooper: Drop your weapons!

Dr. Pershing: No, no, no, no. Pardon. Uh, sorry. I... didn't... mean to alarm.

[ The client gets up and walks around the table to stand in front of the Mandalorian. ]

Client: This is Doctor Pershing. // Please excuse his lack of decorum. // His enthusiasm outweighs his discretion. // Please lower your blaster.

Din Djarin: Have them lower theirs first.

Stormtrooper: We have you four to one.

Din Djarin: I like those odds.

[ The client steps closer. ]

Client: He also said you were expensive. Very expensive. Please sit.

[ On a sign from the client the stormtroopers lower their weapons, as does the Mandalorian. He and the client sit. The client unpacks a cloth package. ]

Din Djarin: Beskar?

Client: Go ahead. It's real.

[ The Mandalorian inspects the ingot. ]

Client: This is only a down payment. I have a camtono of Beskar waiting for you upon delivery of the asset.

Dr. Pershing: Alive.

Client: Yes. Alive. Although, I acknowledge that bounty hunting is a complicated profession. This being the case, proof of termination is also acceptable for a lower fee.

Dr. Pershing: That is not what we agreed upon.

Client: I'm simply being pragmatic.

Din Djarin: Let's see the puck.

Client: I'm afraid discretion dictates a less traditional agreement. We can only offer you a tracking fob.

[ Dr. Pershing hands the Mandalorian a tracking fob. ]

Din Djarin: What's the chain code?

Client: We can only provide the last four digits.

Din Djarin: Their age? That's all you can give me?

Client: Yes. They're 50 years old. We can also give you last reported positional data. Between that and the fob, a man of your skill should make short work of this.

[ The Mandalorian gets up and moves to leave. ]

Client: The Beskar belongs back into the hands of a Mandalorian. It is good to restore the natural order of things after a period of such disarray, don't you agree?

[ The Mandalorian leaves. He walks through town and covertly enters an underground facility, sitting down with a Mandalorian armorer. He places credits and the beskar ingot on the table. ]

Armorer: (Inspecting the ingot.) This was gathered in the Great Purge. It is good it is back with the Tribe.

Din Djarin: Yes.

Armorer: A pauldron would be in order. // Has your signet been revealed?

Din Djarin: Not yet.

Armorer: Soon.

[ The armorer prepares to forge the pauldron. ]

Armorer: This is extremely generous. The excess will sponsor many Foundlings.

Din Djarin: That's good. // I was once a Foundling.

Armorer: I know.

[ While the armorer forges the pauldron, the Mandalorian has flashbacks to a moment of his childhood. He is seen carried by his father, accompanied by his mother, making their way through flighting and explosions until he is hidden away. Then the armorer places the pauldron on his shoulder. ]

[ Cut to the Razor Crest approaching, then landing on Arvala-7. The Mandalorian scans the landscape – until suddenly attacked by a blurrg, a second one joining. They fight until the blurrgs are tranquilized by Kuiil. ]

Din Djarin: Thank you.

Kuiil: You are a bounty hunter.

Din Djarin: Yes.

Kuiil: I will help you. // I have spoken.

[ Cut to Kuiil's residence. ]

Kuiil: Many have passed through. // They seek the same one as you.

Din Djarin: Did you help them?

Kuiil: Yes. // They died.

Din Djarin: Well, then I don't know if I want your help.

Kuiil: You do. I can show you to the encampment.

Din Djarin: What's your cut?

Kuiil: Half.

Din Djarin: Half the bounty to guide? Seems steep.

Kuiil: No. Half of the blurrg you helped capture.

Din Djarin: The blurrg? You can keep them both.

Kuiil: No, you will need one. To ride. The way is impossible to pass without a blurrg mount.

Din Djarin: I don't know how to ride blurrg.

Kuiil: I have spoken.

[ Cut to the Mandalorian being thrown by a blurrg. ]

Kuiil: Perhaps if you removed your helmet.

Din Djarin: Perhaps he remembers I tried to roast him.

Kuiil: This is a female. The males are all eaten during mating.

[ The Mandalorian tries again, and gets thrown again. ]

Din Djarin: I don't have time for this. Do you have a Landspeeder or Speeder bike that I could hire?

Kuiil: You are Mandalorian! Your ancestors rode the great Mythosaur. Surely you can ride this young foal.

[ The Mandalorian approaches the blurrg again. ]

Din Djarin: Easy. Easy. Now, all right. Settle down. Whoa! Settle. Settle. That's good. That's good. Easy. Okay. That's good. All right.

[ He finally mounts the blurrg – and it doesn't throw him. ]

[ Cut to the Mandalorian and Kuiil riding across the landscape on blurrg. ]

Kuiil: That is where you'll find your quarry.

[ The Mandalorian hands Kuiil a bag of credits, but Kuiil waves off. ]

Din Djarin: Please. You deserve this.

Kuiil: Since these ones arrived, this territory has been an endless stream of mercenaries seeking reward and bringing destruction.

Din Djarin: Then why did you guide me?

Kuiil: They do not belong here. Those that live here come to seek peace. There will be no peace until they're gone.

Din Djarin: Then why do you help?

Kuiil: I have never met a Mandalorian. I've only read the stories. If they are true, you will make quick work of it. Then there will again be peace. I have spoken.

[ Cut to the Mandalorian reconning the encampment from a far off cliff edge. ]

Din Djarin: Oh, no. Bounty Droid.

[ Cut to the encampment. ]

IG-11: Subparagraph 16 of the Bondsman Guild protocol waiver compels you to immediately produce said asset.

[ Fighting. The droids shoots all in sight, the rest hole up. ]

Din Djarin: (exasperated) Droids.

IG-11: Subparagraph 16 of the Bondsman Guild protocol waiver compels you to immediately produce said asset.

[ The Mandalorian appears from behind a pillar. ]

Din Djarin: IG Unit! Stand down.

[ A shot from IG-11 throws the Mandalorian backward. ]

Din Djarin: I'm in the Guild!

IG-11: You are a Guild member? I thought I was the only one on assignment.

Din Djarin: That makes two of us. So much for the element of surprise.

IG-11: Sadly, I must ask for your fob. I have already issued the writ of seizure. The bounty is mine.

Din Djarin: Unless I'm mistaken, you are, as of yet, empty-handed.

IG-11: This is true.

Din Djarin: I have a suggestion.

IG-11: Proceed.

Din Djarin: We split the reward.

IG-11: This is acceptable.

Din Djarin: Great. Now let's regroup, out of harm's way, and form a plan.

IG-11: I will of course receive the reputation merits associated with the mission.

Din Djarin: Can we talk about this later?

IG-11: I require an answer if I am to proceed-- Oh, no. Alert. Alert. Alert.

[ Gunfighting. ]

Din Djarin: Let's go!

[ Gunfighting. The Mandalorian pulls out the fob and points to a steel door. ]

Din Djarin: He's in there!

IG-11: Affirmative.

[ Gunfighting. ]

Din Djarin: Up top!

[ They take cover behind pillars while the enemies are surrounding them. ]

IG-11: It appears we are trapped. I will initiate self-destruct sequencing.

Din Djarin: Whoa! You're what?

IG-11: Manufacturers Protocol dictates I cannot be captured. I must self-destruct.

Din Djarin: Do not self-destruct. // Cover me!

[ The Mandalorian attempts to open the door, to no avail. ]

Din Djarin: Go! Go! Go! There's too many!

[ Gunfighting. ]

Din Djarin: They got us pinned.

[ The enemies bring out a heavy gun. ]

IG-11: I will initiate self-destruct.

Din Djarin: Do not self-destruct! We're shooting our way out.

[ They come out of hiding, facing the heavy gun. ]

Din Djarin: Okay...

[ They take cover again. ]

Din Djarin: New plan!

IG-11: Beginning self-destruct countdown.

Din Djarin: No! Stop it! // Draw their fire, I'll take it out.

IG-11: Acceptable.

Din Djarin: Go!

[ The IG unit runs out to draw the fire while the Mandalorian grapples the heavy gun and shoots all remaining enemies. ]

IG-11: Well done. // I will disengage self-destruct initiative.

[ The Mandalorian helps the IG unit up. ]

Din Djarin: You know, you're not so bad. For a droid.

IG-11: Agreed.

Din Djarin: That blaster hit looks nasty. You okay?

IG-11: Running a quick diagnostic. // It has missed my central wiring harness.

Din Djarin: Is that good?

IG-11: Yes.

Din Djarin: Well, now we just need to get the door open.

[ They shoot the door open with the heavy gun. Inside, a lone enemy jumps out – and is shot down. ]

Din Djarin: Anyone else?

IG-11: The tracking fob is still active. My sensors indicate that there is a life form present.

[ The Mandalorian scans the room. The tracking fob leads them to an egg shaped container. He opens it. ]

Din Djarin: Wait. They said 50 years old.

IG-11: Species age differently. // Perhaps it could live many centuries.

[ The Child slowly emerges from a blanket. ]

IG-11: Sadly, we'll never know.

[ The IG unit starts to raise its gun but the Mandalorian stops it. ]

Din Djarin: No. We'll bring it in alive.

IG-11: The commission was quite specific. The asset was to be terminated.

[ A shot is fired. The IG unit drops to the ground, shot down by the Mandalorian. ]

End.
